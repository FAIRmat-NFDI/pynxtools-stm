## Examples in NOMAD
Currently, we have two examples in NOMAD, one for STS (Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy) and one for STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy).
### STS Example
The [STS example](../../src/pynxtools_mpes/nomad/examples/spm/sts) Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) from Scanning Probe Microscopy family. It can transform the data from files generated from nanonis instrument and software into a data format defined by NeXus application definition NXsts.

### STM Example
The [STM example](../../src/pynxtools_mpes/nomad/examples/spm/stm) Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) from Scanning Probe Microscopy family. It can transform the data from files generated from nanonis instrument and software into a data format defined by NeXus application definition NXstm.
